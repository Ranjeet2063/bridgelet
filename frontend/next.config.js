   * HTTP response headers applied per-route.
   *
   * /claim/[token] places the claim credential in the URL path, which means
   * it would be forwarded in the `Referer` request header to every
   * sub-resource loaded on that page (fonts, analytics beacons, images).
   * Because this token authorises a fund sweep, leaking it to a third-party
   * CDN or analytics endpoint before the recipient claims is a genuine
   * funds-security risk (see issue #392 and docs/security-model.mdx §Claim
   * Token Security).
   *
   * `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` ensures the browser sends no `Referer`
   * header at all for any navigation *away from* or sub-resource *loaded on*
   * the claim page.  This is the most conservative choice and is appropriate
   * here because:
   *   1. The claim page has no SEO value that depends on referrer analytics.
   *   2. No third-party widgets on this page need the origin URL to function.
   *   3. The alternative — `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` — would still
   *      send the full path (including the token) to same-origin sub-resources,
   *      which is unnecessarily broad.
   *
   * Note: the path segment decision (vs. URL fragment `#token=...`) is
   * documented in docs/security-model.mdx under "Claim Token Placement".
